# Countdown


This project is a web page that features a visually appealing countdown timer. Users can input a target date and time, and the timer dynamically calculates and displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until that specified moment. The page includes error handling for missing input and offers a "Try Again" button once the countdown reaches zero. It's a straightforward and user-friendly tool for tracking time intervals.
